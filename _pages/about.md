I am a research scientist at [Hume AI](https://hume.ai/) and postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Dacher Keltner.

I started my current position in 2021 after receiving my PhD from [New York University's Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), where I worked with Jon Freeman in the [Social Cognitive and Neural Sciences Lab](https://freemanlab.org/). Before that, I received my BA in Philosophy from Tufts University, where I discovered my love for psychology and neuroscience research as an RA in the late Nalini Ambady's lab. Before starting grad school, I also spent a few years getting fMRI training as a research assistant at Duke and lab manager for [Kristen Lindquist](https://carolinaaffectivescience.com/) at UNC Chapel Hill.

My guiding research interest is to develop better computational and cognitive models of social perception, and to uncover how our incredible ability to quickly glean high-level social, cognitive, and affective information from perceiving others is achieved in the brain. The main focus of my research thus far has been to integrate approaches from experimental psycholgy, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience to investigate social and cognitive influences on emotion perception. At Hume, I use large-scale statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze the structure of the (very) large datasets used to train the company's emotion AI models.
