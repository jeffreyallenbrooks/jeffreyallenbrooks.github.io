I am a cognitive and affective scientist broadly interested in how we perceive and understand one another. My research incorporates brain imaging, machine learning, motion-tracking, and online data collection, alongside traditional behavioral methods. 

Currently I am a research scientist at [Hume AI](https://hume.ai/), where I use statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze the structure of the (very) large datasets used to train the company's emotion AI models. 

I started my current position in 2021 after receiving my PhD from [New York University's Department of Psychology](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology.html), where I worked with Jon Freeman in the [Social Cognitive and Neural Sciences Lab](https://freemanlab.org/). Before that, I received my BA in Philosophy from Tufts University, where I got my start in psychology and neuroscience research as an RA in the late [Nalini Ambady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalini_Ambady)'s lab. Before starting grad school, I also spent a few years getting fMRI training as a research assistant at Duke and lab manager for [Kristen Lindquist](https://carolinaaffectivescience.com/) at UNC Chapel Hill.
