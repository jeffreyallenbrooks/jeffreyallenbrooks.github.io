Social perception
======

We’re able to look at another person and get a vivid impression of their emotions and personality characteristics. These rapid inferences seem to show up automatically for us and can be both startingly accurate and systematically biased. But how do we actually do this?

Many nuanced patterns of social perception and categorization have been documented by psychologists but it was only fairly recently that a critical mass of researchers started thinking about this as a fundamentally perceptual process - this "social vision" approach fascinated me when I first learned about it and has guided my research ever since. 

and what this showed is that the perceptual system is also highly attuned to extract socially relevant information from the environment. 

Understanding the social world we navigate every day as fundamentally organized and mediated by the perceptual system is a fascination of mine


Emotion
======

While I had started investigating how much our impressions of others depend on perceptual information vs. high-level social cognitive-processes, emotion science was debating similar questions including how much our perceptions of others’ emotions depend on sensory signals (e.g., facial movements) vs. our own expectations and context.

What can we understand about facial emotion perception by taking a “social vision” approach (grounding our study of this process in the fact that it is a fundamentally visual perceptual process)?



Computational approaches to brain and behavior
======
How does the brain represent social categories and emotions?

How can we make models in psychology more computationally specified? What will the field look like as methods and findings are increasingly shaped by ML and how can we prepare for it? 


and how will it communicate findings (both internally and externally) when/if it becomes a more mathematical/less readily interpretable science?


Social psychology has favored two-dimensional models for a long time,


Bridging computational and traditional approaches to emotion, social perception, and cognition

I’m broadly interested in the theoretical issues posed by this fascinating new era of science~

Etc.

Aside from s c i e n c e, I like yoga, cooking, guitar, <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/ourannual">video games</a>, and try to read as much as possible (if you're particularly bored feel free to <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jeffreyallenbrooks">check out the books I've been reading</a>)
