Weâ€™re able to look at another person - even a total stranger - and get a vivid impression of their emotions and mental state.

How do we do this? 

Whether or not our perceptions of others are accurate, it's clear that the perceptual system extracts and efficiently, flexibly represents incredibly complex information about what others are thinking and feeling. 

How is the brain accomplishing this high-level information extraction from a computational perspective?

Thinking about social perception, and in particular emotion perception, in these terms has been a guiding research interest for me. And it was only fairly recently that we gained the methods and conceptual tools to grasp the problem from this perspective.

### social vision

You might call this a computational <a href="

This paper review some of the major conceptual benefits of this approach and how it can help us understand how social information is perceived and represented, including interpretation of brain imaging findings:

### emotion perception

My first major line of research applied this approach to facial expressions - borrowing concepts from vision science, to what extent can we think of this process in terms of "bottom-up" and "top-down" processes (i.e., the relative influence of perceptual cues on the face vs. pre-existing perceptual heuristics and biases in the observer). This also weighs in on debates about the role of conceptual knowledge in emotion, and the ability for cognitive processes to influence perception more generally. These papers investigate this question using computational methods applied to behavioral and brain imaging data, respectively:

Please feel free to reach out to me by email if you want to discuss any of these areas of research, or to just let me know you reached the bottom of this page.

Aside from s c i e n c e, I like yoga, cooking, guitar, video games, and try to read as much as possible (if you're particularly bored feel free to <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jeffreyallenbrooks">check out the books I've been reading</a>)
