### My research uses new computational tools to look into old questions about how we perceive and understand one another.

<font size="2">
Weâ€™re able to look at another person - even a total stranger - and get a vivid impression of their emotions and mental state. But how do we actually do this? 
<br>
Whether or not our perceptions of others are accurate, it's clear that the perceptual system extracts and efficiently, flexibly represents incredibly complex information about what others are thinking and feeling. 
<br>
How is the brain accomplishing this high-level information processing from a computational perspective? How much of the richness of social cognition comes from raw perception vs. abstract, culturally-shaped ideas about what humans are like (or should be like)?
<br>
Thinking about social perception in these terms has broadly guided my research, and it was only fairly recently that we gained the methods and conceptual tools to grasp the problem from this perspective.

This paper review some of the major conceptual benefits of this approach and how it can help us understand how social information is perceived and represented, including interpretation of brain imaging findings:

### Emotion

<font size="2">
My first major line of research applied this approach to facial expressions - borrowing concepts from vision science, to what extent can we think of this process in terms of "bottom-up" and "top-down" processes (i.e., the relative influence of perceptual cues on the face vs. pre-existing perceptual heuristics and biases in the observer). This also weighs in on debates about the role of conceptual knowledge in emotion, and the ability for cognitive processes to influence perception more generally. These papers investigate this question using computational methods applied to behavioral and brain imaging data, respectively:

### Computational approaches to brain and behavior

<font size="2">
My research approach is motivated by computational approaches to cognition and a desire to bring in new mathematical and statistical tools so that psychological science can capture and describe more of the nuance and complexity we're familiar with in our daily lives.
<br>
Models and taxonomies in psychology tend to be very reductive - six basic emotions, two dimensions of social perception, dual-process models of learning, memory, morality. We have endured a massive gap between the obvious richness and complexity of human life and the ways we can describe and measure it scientifically.
<br>
In my work at <a href="https://hume.ai/about">Hume</a>, I'm currently working on this problem in the domain of emotion - using machine learning in conjunction with massive experimentally controlled datasets to determine new ways to measure, represent, and model human emotion, and how these methods can remain sensitive to complex variability between individuals and cultures.

### The future of models in psychology

<font size="2">
More broadly, we're entering a fascinating new phase of science where unprecedented amounts of data and technological advances in our capability to process and derive insights from huge amounts of data are slowly opening a door on a completely new way to do psychological science, to think about psychological science.
<br>
This might mean that psychological science captures more of the truth of how we work, but in order to do this, it might have to use mathematical descriptions that abstract very far away from our daily experience of being human. What will this be like? How can we prepare for it? If today's psychology is classical mechanics, what is psychology's string theory?

Aside from science I like yoga, cooking, guitar, video games, and exploring new york city, which gets bigger the longer I live here. I try to read as much as possible and you can feel free to check out the books I've been reading <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jeffreyallenbrooks">here</a>.
